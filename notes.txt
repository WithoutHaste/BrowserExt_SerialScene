next steps?

YES: should options show even empty folders?

To support xkcd: if the last char in url is "/" then take off the next segment too
ex: http://xkcd.com/794/

some comics have their homepage as "current" - don't update url to a simpler (just the domain) url, keep it at the more complex specific-page

To support basic instructions and many blogs:
look for the "yyyy/mm/dd" blog format - if it's there, count all that into the changing filename
